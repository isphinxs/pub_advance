# Publication Advance Sinatra MVC Application

This is an MVC (model-view-controller) application using Sinatra.  It allows authors to create accounts, add books that they've written and the publication advances they've received from them, and view books and advances received by other authors.

This project aims to provide a platform for authors to track and compare advances, with the goal of addressing inequity in the publishing industry.

## Installation

Clone this repo and run `bundle install`.  Start the server with `shotgun` and navigate in your browser to `http://localhost:9393`.

## Usage

Users can create an account to view authors, books, and advances, and to add their own books and advances.
